# aurelia-compose-deactivate

This project is bootstrapped by [aurelia/new](https://github.com/aurelia/new).

## Start dev web server

    npm start

## Open the browser console

Use the 'Switch Component' and 'Switch Model' buttons to toggle the component and model.  Both components have activate and deactivate hooks defined which write to the console but the console only displays messages from the activate hook.
